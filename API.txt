Mage support apicalls.

The calls should always have the following parameter data:
apikey = the apikey
ugid = the ugid of the user performing the action

Api specific calls:

vouchers/api_create:
A action made to simplify api call creating of vouchers

parameters:
:voucher => {
  :serie => the serie letter (M, K, C etc.)
  :activity_year => The activity year (2011 etc)
  :authorized_by => ugid of user who authorized
  :material_from => ugid of user who gave material
  :organ_id => Id of organ (optional, default to default organ for series)
  :title => Title of voucher
  :accounting_date => The accounting date
  :voucher_rows => [
    {
      :sum => +/- sum (+= Debet, - = Kredit)
      :arrangement => The arrangement number
      :account_number => The accountnumber
    },
    ...
  ]
}

This should be placed in the request body. 

A checksum calculated by taking the request body and appending the private key should be sent an extra parameter (not in the request body) (get or post)

If one is using rails the api_call.rb modell can be used
